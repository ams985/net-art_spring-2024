    You start slowly letting yourself down the mountain. It's steep, but you feel secure holding
    onto the mountain. The clouds are all around you, it's a bright day, and you see a dense
    amount of trees underneath you. As you get further down, some rocks chip off and fall under you.
    Before you know it, you are falling. Dazed, you get up to realize that you are inside the dense forest.
    At one end, you see a light at the end of the path. The other way leads into darkness.
