    <h1><strong><a href="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*bR1Q9BHgcLdad31FKjfx0g.jpeg" target=”blank”>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,</a></strong></h1>
    <h2>And sorry I could not travel both</h2>
    <h3>And be one traveler, long I stood</h3>
    <h4>And looked down one as far as I could</h4>
    <h5>To where it bent in the undergrowth;</h5>
    
   <ol>
        <li><h5>Then took the other, as just as fair,</h5></li>
        <li><h4>And having perhaps the better claim,</h4></li>
        <li><h3>Because it was grassy and wanted wear;</h3></li>
        <li><h2>Though as for that the passing there</h2></li>
        <li><h1>Had worn them really about the same,</h1></li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
        <li><h1>And both that morning equally lay</h1></li>
        <li><h2>In leaves no step had trodden black.</h2></li>
        <li><h3>Oh, I kept the first for another day!</h3></li>
        <li><h4>Yet knowing how way leads on to way,</h4></li>
        <li><h5>I doubted if I should ever come back.</h5></li>
    </ul>

    <h5>I shall be telling this with a sigh</h5>
    <h4>Somewhere ages and ages hence:</h4>
    <h3>Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—</h3>
    <h2>I took the one less traveled by,</h2>
    <h1><em>And that has made all the difference.</em></h1>
