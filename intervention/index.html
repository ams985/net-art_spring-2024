        <h1>Doodles for Discord</h1>

        <p>Discord interested me because it was really accesible and
        has communities where it was a possiblity for me to reach
        a large group of people easily. I could also keep myself anonymous, which is how I would feel most comfortable.
        I also felt like in a discord community, people would be more open and therefore more willing to accept and respond to my prompt.</p>

        <p>My intervention was going onto different discords and posting for people
        to give me prompts of things to draw. I would then draw them and send them
        into the chat. I wanted to see how many people would respond and be interested, and I would enjoy making quick drawings of different things.
        It happened in one day, on Tuesday, March 5th, because I knew that after initially posting, the only responses I would get would be immediate.</p>

        <p>My intervention resulted in several people responding to my request with prompts,
        and me drawing them then posting them in the Mason Gross Discord. However, after my initial message, not a lot of people responded.
        However, for the prompts I did get, I did enjoy drawing them.</p>

        <p>In the public anime chat I joined, one person asked if there was a specific theme I wanted, and I responded no, but then I got no requests anyway.
        Overall I expected at least some responses from both chats, but only got some for one.</p>

        <p>To expand on this project, I would create a more permanent way for people to offer prompts, and find a way
        for it to keep running, maybe by creating and maintaining a new discord group.</p>
