    <h1>Scribbles</h1>
    <p class="mainParagraph">The pieces curated for this exhibition share a simple yet profound aspect found across many media: drawing. They all utilize the process of drawing with the contribution of other factors; whether it being an online painting tool, a random generator, or music and record-setting goals. Each piece shows profoundly different takes on the concept of drawing, and it shows in their results. The first, titled Brushes, showcases a series of 8 artists' online paintings, them in-and-of themselves looking different. Some include animation, some follow more minimal styles, and they all use a variety of tools. The Longest Whistlegraph Ever (so far) is a video or people committing the longest act of Whistle Graphing; they merged singing with drawing for 20 minutes to create an overall work of art. The last piece was a landscape generator, using the computer to randomly create landscapes out of previously drawn landscapes.</p>
